bs = (G_BKZ = 36.03 gate, B_BKZ = 48.55 bit cum-pr = 1.00, dsvp = 0.00, dsvp_r =   0, G_dsvp = 0.00 gate, B_dsvp = 0.00 bit, G = 36.03 gate, B = 48.55 bit)
Block size strategy generated by BSSA (beta,jump,tours):{(185,  2,  3),(196,  4,  1)}
Min Cost = 36.03 log2(sec), Memory Cost = 48.55 log(bit)
BSSA cost:7.6e+02s.
