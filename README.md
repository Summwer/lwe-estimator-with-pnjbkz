# Guidance





Code in `enumbs-estimation-cpp` implements the EnumBS algorithm, and the security estimation of NIST-round3 schemes and some unsolved lwe challenges in EnumBS. The guidance in implementing the code is following `README.md` in `enumbs-estimation-cpp`.

Code in `sage` implements default g6k estimation, bkz-only estimation, BSSA estimation and the computation of memory cost for EnumBS estimation. It should be implemented in a sage 9.1+ environment.
