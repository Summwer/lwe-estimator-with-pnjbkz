# Guidance





Code in `enumbs-estimation-cpp` implements the EnumBS algorithm, and the security estimation of NIST-round3 schemes and lwe challenges(https://www.latticechallenge.org/lwe_challenge/challenge.php) in EnumBS and BSSA. The guidance in implementing the code is following `README.md` in `enumbs-estimation-cpp`.

Code in `sage` implements default g6k estimation, bkz-only estimation, pro-bkz estimation and two-step estimation. It should be implemented in a sage 9.1+ environment.

More details about the above algorithims can be seen in the artical https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1343.pdf .
